    <!-- Short description of the Recipe -->
    <p> A delicious pepper steak recipe served with boiled white rice — easy and made from items you may already have in your cupboards! </p>
    <!-- Ingredients list -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steak</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch squares</li>

    <!-- Method Guide -->
     <h2>Guide</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</li>
        <li>Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.</li>
     </ol>
